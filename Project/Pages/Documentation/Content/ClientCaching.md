## Client Caching

This concern adds an `eTag` header to every response generated by the server
so that clients send a `If-None-Match` header to validate their cache. If the
content did not change on the server, the handler will generate a `304 Not Modified`
response, causing the client to re-use the locally cached data. This way, clients
revisiting your web application load faster and the load on your server is reduced.

This concern is part of the [default configuration](./defaults) and will automatically
be added.
