                    Downloads allow to serve a single file with a fixed name to your clients. The content type
                    of the file will automatically be determined by it&apos;s extension.

                    <pre><code class="csharp">layout.Add("agb.pdf", Download.FromFile("/var/www/documents/agb.pdf"))</code></pre>

                    In this example, the file would be available at http://localhost/agb.pdf.
                    As with static content, downloads can also be served from your embedded resources.
