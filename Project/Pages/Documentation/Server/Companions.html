                    As the server is designed to require as few dependencies as possible, it will neither create log files
                    nor log errors to the console. You can register a <a href="https://github.com/Kaliumhexacyanoferrat/GenHTTP/blob/master/API/GenHTTP.API/Infrastructure/IServerCompanion.cs">Companion</a>
                    instance that allows you to handle errors and log requests:

                    <pre><code class="csharp">public class ConsoleCompanion : IServerCompanion
{
 
    public void OnRequestHandled(IRequest request, IResponse response, Exception? error)
    {
        Console.Log(request.Path);
    }

    public void OnServerError(ServerErrorScope scope, Exception error)
    {
        Console.Log(error);
    }

}</code></pre>

                    If you are fine with a simple console-based logger, chain the following call to your server setup:

                    <pre><code class="csharp">var server = Server.Create().Router(...).Console();</code></pre>

                </p>

                <p>

                    As companion methods are called synchronously on the thread the request is handled in,
                    you should not perform heavy, long-running tasks in those methods.
